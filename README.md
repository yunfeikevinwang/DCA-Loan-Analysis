## Abstract
Using data provided by USAID on the Development Credit Authority (DCA) loan program, which
aims to promote economic development through credit guarantees, we employed OLS Regression and
Machine Learning models to estimate the determinants of loan size. The region, business size and
sector, and the gender of the entrepreneur have significant effects on the final loan amount received by
the borrower. Women entrepreneurs receive more than 25% smaller loans than male entrepreneurs for
similar businesses and are given loans at a rate below the number of businesses they own nationally. These
findings suggest the following improvements to the program: 1. Reducing the political influences on the
program, 2. Better assessments on if loans are going to business owners who would not have otherwise,
and most importantly, 3. Increasing loan frequency and loan amounts to women entrepreneurs.
